**Project Title:**  
Smart Legal Document Analysis Platform

---

**Project Description:**  
This project involves building an AI-powered platform that helps legal professionals analyze and interpret legal documents such as contracts, case law, and statutes. By integrating LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system can extract clauses, summarize content, and answer complex legal queries in natural language. A user-friendly web interface allows users to upload documents and interact with the system seamlessly.

**Objective / Tools Used:**
**Objective:**
- To streamline the legal document review process using AI    
- To enable faster clause identification, case comparison, and intelligent legal search    
- To make legal insights more accessible, even to non-technical users    

**Tools Used:**
- **Python** – Backend logic, integration with AI services
- **LangChain** – For prompt orchestration and connecting LLMs with retrieval systems
- **LLMs** – For natural language understanding and summarization (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama)
- **SQL** – To manage structured legal metadata (e.g., case IDs, filing dates, jurisdictions)    
- **Vector Database** (e.g., ChromaDB or FAISS) – For storing and retrieving legal document embeddings    
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – To enhance LLM responses with contextually relevant legal content    
- **Web Interface** – For file uploads, queries, and displaying results
