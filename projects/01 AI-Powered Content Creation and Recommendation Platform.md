# AI-Powered Content Creation and Recommendation Platform

## Core Components:

### 1. Content Creation Module

- **Model Switchboard**: Interface allowing content creators to select from different LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc.) based on the specific content needs
- **Personality Templates**: Pre-defined writer personas with specialized knowledge and writing styles for different content types:
    - Technical blog personalities (e.g., "The Developer Advocate," "The System Architect")
    - Fiction writer personalities (e.g., "Sci-Fi Author," "Mystery Writer")
- **Content Generation Pipeline**: LangChain orchestration to handle prompt engineering, content generation, and revision

### 2. Database Architecture
- **SQL Database Schema**:
    - Content tables (articles, metadata, revision history)
    - Model performance metrics
    - Personality template configurations
    - User interaction data
    - Vectorized content embeddings for similarity matching
### 3. RAG-Powered Recommendation Engine

- Content embedding generation using appropriate models
- Vector database integration for efficient similarity searching
- Recommendation algorithm that combines:
    - Content similarity
    - User reading history
    - Article popularity and engagement metrics
    - Topic relevance

### 4. Reader Experience

- Clean reading interface for consuming content
- Smart sidebar with the top 5 similar articles based on similarity scores
- Feedback mechanism to improve recommendations
- Optional user accounts to track reading history and provide personalized recommendations

## Technical Implementation:

1. Use Python for the backend services and LangChain integration
2. Implement SQL database (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension) for structured data and vector storage
3. Create an embeddings pipeline to vectorize all content for similarity matching
4. Build a recommendation API that uses RAG to enhance similarity matching with semantic understanding
5. Develop monitoring tools to track which AI models perform best for different content types

This project provides real value by:

1. Increasing content creation efficiency through AI assistance
2. Ensuring content quality by matching the right LLM to the content type
3. Improving reader engagement through intelligent content recommendations
4. Creating a feedback loop that continuously improves both content creation and recommendations
5. Providing insights into which AI models excel at different writing tasks

**Project Title:**  
AI-Powered Content Creation and Recommendation Platform

**Project Description:**  
This project is an end-to-end platform that empowers users to generate high-quality content using Large Language Models (LLMs) and delivers personalized reading experiences through a smart recommendation engine. It combines AI-driven content generation with reader behavior analytics and semantic search for intelligent content discovery.

**Objective / Tools Used:**  
**Objective:**

- To streamline the content creation process using AI tools    
- To deliver personalized content recommendations to readers based on semantic similarity and behavior tracking

**Tools & Technologies Used:**

- **LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini, (integrated via LangChain)    
- **LangChain**: For orchestrating prompts and content pipelines    
- **MySQL**: Structured data storage 
- And **ChromaDB** for  storing embeddings and VSS    
- **Python**: Backend development and API integration    
- **Vector Embeddings**: For content similarity using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)    
- **SQL schema design**: For tracking model performance, content metadata, and user interactions    

**Outcome:**  
Learners will gain a hands-on understanding of:
- How to integrate and orchestrate multiple LLMs using LangChain    
- Building modular AI tools like personality-driven prompt templates    
- Designing SQL database schemas for AI and content workflows    
- Implementing RAG pipelines for enhanced content similarity search
