    "The `aggregation_strategy` parameter in the NER pipeline addresses a critical issue that arises from how transformer tokenizers work with named entity recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Aggregation Strategy Is Required\n",
    "\n",
    "When using transformers for NER (Named Entity Recognition), there's a fundamental mismatch between:\n",
    "1. How tokenizers split words (into subwords/wordpieces)\n",
    "2. How NER labels need to be applied (typically at the whole word/entity level)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at what happens when you process \"Bill Gates\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The tokenizer might split this into: [\"Bill\", \"Gate\", \"##s\"]\n",
    "2. Each token gets its own prediction from the model\n",
    "3. But you want one cohesive entity: \"Bill Gates\" as a PERSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Without an aggregation strategy, you'd get separate predictions for each subtoken:\n",
    "- \"Bill\" → PERSON\n",
    "- \"Gate\" → PERSON\n",
    "- \"##s\" → PERSON\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates several issues:\n",
    "- Entity boundaries become unclear\n",
    "- Confidence scores may vary across subtokens\n",
    "- Post-processing becomes necessary to rebuild complete entities\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Aggregation Strategies Do\n",
    "\n",
    "The `aggregation_strategy` parameter tells the pipeline how to combine these subtoken predictions into meaningful entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'none'`: No aggregation (raw predictions for each subtoken)\n",
    "- `'simple'`: Group adjacent tokens with the same entity label\n",
    "- `'first'`: Use the prediction of the first subtoken for the whole word\n",
    "- `'average'`: Average the scores across subtokens\n",
    "- `'max'`: Use the highest confidence prediction from the subtokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Our Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nlp = pipeline('ner',\n",
    "              model=model,\n",
    "              tokenizer=tokenizer,\n",
    "              aggregation_strategy='max', \n",
    "              device='cpu')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `aggregation_strategy='max'` means:\n",
    "1. For multi-subtoken words/entities, the pipeline will identify all subtokens belonging to the same word\n",
    "2. It will use the prediction with the highest confidence score as the label for the entire word/entity\n",
    "3. The result will be a single prediction for \"Bill Gates\" instead of separate predictions for each subtoken\n"
